# KFC Quickstart

Use this page as the shortest path to run Kami Flow Codex (KFC) correctly.

## Run in KFC Repo

This is the maintainer and dogfooding repository (`kamiflow-codex-starter`).

```bash
npm install
npm run bootstrap
```

If you need to test KFC inside this repo fixtures:

```bash
npm run dogfood:link
npm run dogfood:smoke
```

If you need client linking, prepare the package from this repo once:

```bash
npm run link:self
```

## Run in Client Project

Do not use `npm run ...` from this repo in client projects.

In the client project:

```bash
kfc client
```

Then tell Codex:

- Read `.kfc/CODEX_READY.md` and execute the mission.

After work is complete, cleanup is required:

```bash
kfc client done
```

## Troubleshooting

- `kfc: command not found`: run `npm link @kamishino/kamiflow-codex` again in the client project.
- Missing plan UI: rerun `kfc client --force`.
- Plan bootstrap failed: run `kfc flow ensure-plan --project .` (or `kfc plan init --project . --new` as compatibility fallback).
- Rules mismatch: rerun `kfc client --force`.
- In KFC repo after skill edits, if runtime instructions are stale: run `npm run codex:sync:skills -- --force`.
